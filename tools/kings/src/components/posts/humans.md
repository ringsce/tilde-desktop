Devotion

- Help me, help me…

The voice has been heard. I cannot see from where it came. I cannot understand. The shallows dig. The graveyards were dug. The songs are sung or sung. The autumn came. The horror came from the inside out. The screams kept being so shallow. The blood is running out. I am Ekron, the King of Bathleron.

- Help me, help me. I don't know who I am. Where am I?

The shouts kept being shouted. The digs kept being dug. The graveyards are being dug. I heard voices. I can't understand from where it came.

- Help me.

Again heard. Again heard. I still cannot understand. I looked up. I saw someone falling. Someone is scared of being fallen.

I was a fallen King, from a fallen kingdom. Now I am the King. The King of Bathleron.


- Who are you?

- I am your guidance, your shadow here.

- I am everything to you. I am your wife, your confidant, your beauty in your throne.

- What is your name?

- Magdalene. I am your wife. The real wife. You are the King of all.

- So, you are my wife. Why did you fall?

- Dear, I feel that God has a gift for you. You are the King of all. The king of kindness, the goodness.

- Dear, You are the child of GOD. So, I am your wife, your Magdalene.

- You should now believe in us. Much now. You are and you will guide us all.

- But I am the fallen.

- You are not the fallen. You must believe more than ever. You are God's son. Karlyn was your father. You must go to his work. You must believe now. You are the chosen. You are wise. The cheer. The laughter. The home. Everyone surrounds you because they believe. You are the chosen.





So Magdalene went with Ekron back home. They are walking over the gardens of Bathleron, the gardens with so many labyrinths. He knows them so well. When he went back to the throne, he decided to make a statement to the people.





The announcement was on the same day, the same day Magdalene went back. He made the schedule for 3 pm that day.





3 pm:

Ekron with Magdalene at the balcony. They await the persons. After a few minutes are tons of people to reach them.

- Dear citizens, I am glad to speak here today. We are today to celebrate our community. Our devotion to Ekronian Faith. Magdalene is my wife. We will rule our Kingdom as peace as it should.

- Dear citizens, we will rule the Kingdom as before. As the stars align on the horizon.


They went back to the room. Where two thrones are imposed on them. The two chairs only gloom when the true woman comes. We made the test of the two chairs. Yes, it is gloom.

- Who are you, Magdalene?

- I am an Angel, to help you as a wife. I am a true believer. I am an angel conceived only for you. I have the gloom, only for your throne. I was conceived because the world is mean to you. So, I am the conception to make you happy. I am the glamour. The glamorous angel conceived as a woman only for you. Sometimes, GOD helps us all. For you, my love, HE conceived as an image only for you. Just only eyes for you. Remember, your cousin wants your throne. She wants to be glamorous. She won't get the Kingdom. She doesn't shine like me. She is poison. That's why Karlyn sent me. As I told you, You are kind, and good, see no evil. Instead, your cousin wants to get married to you, but she won't get it. The people of Bathleron are protecting you. They know about me. They are believers, they have eyes. The times of tides are coming. The engulfing of the world is near. Be careful with your cousin. I will guide you. Remember your Grandpa Ekron prophetized the religion as Ekronian because he saw the grandchild as the future of mankind. So, the Bathleron kingdom is protecting you. Always. That's the vow at me. And vowed at you. We cannot close our eyes now. We must have them opened. Follow my leads and you will be fine. You will be fine, trust me. We as a family will take care of you. Even in pain. Your grandpa is here. Always here. Don't forget him. He is awake with your antecedents. They are alive, remember always. You are the GOD's child. You are the King and the Prophet. You are the will. You are the soldier that never quits. Don't be scared, all be fine now. You are the warrior. Look at me. Look at me.

- Why should I look at you?

- Look at me. You are the prince of everyone. My handsome. You are fine now. Look at me, don't cry. It's all fine now. Look at me, don't fall no more. Please, please don't fall. Tell me, who are you? Tell me.

- I am Ekron, the King of Bathleron. I am the Knight.

- See, You are someone. You are kind too, you are good too. You will be greater, will be great.

- You are my shining star. Don't fail me again or GOD. You are someone for us. The warrior our Knight. We are together because the stars told us to be. The stars are us. The stars belong to us. We must love each other. We must gather. We are the siblings. We are twins the pair of the duo as a shining star.

- We must move one now. We are in peace not for much longer. Your cousin of Shashiwawa wants both thrones.


Shishiwawa is a beautiful place with samurais. Led by Ekron's cousin. She is very beautiful, with an angelical face, body, with a beautiful silhouette. Good boobs, a nice body, and ass. Like a romantic, wish woman for sex. She remembers a woman futile and ready for sex. Ekron doesn't like her because of that. Shishiwawa is a very beautiful place with cascades, rivers, and snots.

It's a wonderful place to be. Not to live. The city is mundane. Too much. I cannot see how Carla is so obsessed with my throne. She has a good kingdom. I think she wants to have two kingdoms to rule most of the men's kingdoms around. She is so obsessed. So obsessed that she can't see clearly. She only thinks about hurting people and her beauty, and her futile childishness.

We cannot understand why she is doing this. She is so mean and shallow. The hunger is so much in-depth. Carla must be defeated. I cannot see how she will be defeated. The hunger is being eaten by her. Carla is a dystopian Kingdom. She is the apocalypse hunger. Another will to be erased. Superstitions affected. We are the hunger. I song a sung. To be sang



The will is silent

The morning is a defeated

Moment in clockwise

Don't be wise.


The flowers bloom

Cannot be eaten

I ate it all

All the flowers bloom.

Don't be broken

We are Dystopia

We are the eyes.


This song is always sung when the war comes. The war is near, the war is near. Can you dig? Can you be the oblivion? I know we are the memories. We are the memories floating. We are cancer, the memories. Floating under the siege. We are the shallows inside the memories. Arise, Arise, We are here. Can you feel this? Can feel? Its silence. No more enemies. No more purity. We are the denial.

The other song to be sung is life.

Life is alive

Over my veins

I saw trees

I saw the summer.

I am not afraid

I am the hunger

Another breaker

Because I am here.

Creation is so beautiful. The generations are saying come on. The generations are telling us to come on. Our hearts are with you. The dreams are telling me how to live today. Suffering no more. No more demons. New demons no more. It's my oblivion now. It's my second life awakening. Silence is silent in both ways.

We are the reason to live. We are the treasons to be erased. We are the hunger. Remember who you are. Always for you. Always there for you. This is my devotion to you. A silent devotion. Another devotion. Here we go. Unleash me. This is my world, this is Gaia. Game on. Who we are now? Who we were? Who we were now? For eternity I accomplished everything. I wonder how I did that. I am a screamer. I am the world of Gaia whispering. How have I become? The riddles shining us all. The roof of the top won't be a break. I am the alliance, the war to be unleashed. I became the war. Who we are?

Creation is so beautiful. We are Kings. I am the night, I am the light. What have I done?

What have you become? I am the king. I am the man with a crown. No crown gone. Suffocation gone. No more regrets. Silence is lethal. No more silence silent. Ready to fuse it. I am the dream for a city, for a population. Ready to aim. Ready to war. Silence is lethal. Silence is silent. We are the weapon. We are the words. We are the words chosen wisely. We spit venom. We spit venom.

We are the devotion. We spitted venom on your hearts. We are venomous. We spitted my generation's DNA. I cannot see now. I came by the lights. Magdalene helps me. I am yours. I cannot see clearly. No more regrets. No more anger times. In the end, we will conquer us all. Magdalene helps me.

I am wise, I am worried. I need help. Help me out, Magdalene. We are sublets. You are the will. The dream of everyone. Embrace me. Can you help me? Can you help me?

Can you feel my heart? Can you feel it? I am the King. I am the warrior. I am the denial of the sentence. Can you feel it? Magdalene helps me, I cannot see clearly.

- Dear, I will help you. You are my will. You are my devotion. You are my creed. You are my gold. You are my golden shine. Don't be worried. I am with you. I don't want to see you falling again.


- Who am I? Who am I? Am I the King? Am I the will? Am I the golden shining star? Who am I?

- Dear, I am with you. Stay with me, please. Stay with me, please. Can you kiss me? Can you kiss me?

The autumn came. The sorrow came. Bathleron arises. Whom? Shishiwawa falls. Wil fall, didn't will? Bathleron has arisen. The gates opened. They will open. Will see the wrath arises? I will see depth moments of breathing. The autumn came. The decisions, the bad or the wise ones sometimes have thriven us to another level.

It's another leak. On the corner I see demons. The past ones. This is the hard life, the real one.

The hours came as a timeline. The war is coming… Is near… We cannot see now. We are in rage, so naive. We are another bomb.

- Who am I? Who am I?

- Dear, don't fall again. Please, don't fall. I am here. Right here. Listen to your heart. It's the demons we settle away. Listen to your head. Who is right now? Another time to kill men. You are the chosen one. Settle everything. It's time to see us together. Show to the people, who we are. They know who I am. Don't get choked. Be true and real. It's time for that. Are you with me? Are you with me? Gimme your hand, please. Gimme it. Gimme if you love me.

- Sure, I will.

Ekron gave her the hand, now they are in bond. Now it's time for war. Ready for war. The time for was has come. Bathleron is at war now. It's time for another bomb. It's a turn-key in motion. My witness is so reckless. What is happening with this whole world? Now testify. Now testify. It's coming to a new King, a new Crown to carry on. It has been erased. Let's run outside. It's time to set bombs. It's coming a new crown. It came forever the future to be the show itself.

Let's testify. Let's testify outside. Let's move on. Let's carry on. This is war now. This is war, another charade in a casket. No more lies. You are the GOD's rage, the fist, the right hand of GOD.

Lights out. This is vile. In a small village. Bathleron is in war, in pain.

- Who am I? Who am I?

- Who am I? Who am I?

- The best place to be here. The best place to be. No one cannot stop us. I can control everyone but I cannot control myself. Remember the names. I am the subliminal warrior. I have an Empire to rule.

No more freedom anymore. I am silent. I am the clock that turns in backward. I can't be speechless now.
